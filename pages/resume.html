        <p>
            My name is Bilal Ahmadzai, and I have been living in Cincinnati, Ohio, since 2017. I recently graduated
            with an Associate of Applied Science in Computer Support and Administration from Cincinnati State Technical
            and Community College in May 2024, earning a 3.6 GPA. Currently, I work full-time as an IT
            Specialist at CABVI (Cincinnati Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired), where I support the
            organization's technology needs. Additionally, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
            with an Army ROTC Commission at the University of Cincinnati, expecting to graduate in May 2026.
